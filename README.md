# Repo for learning cryptography

### Basics

#### Factoring

- [x] Trial Division algorithm
- [ ] Pollard's rho factoring algorithm
- [ ] ...



### Learning With Errors (LWE)
- [x] Basic understanding of LWE
- [x] First easy implementation (one dimensional matrix), so we are dealing with
  equations in the form of $13s = 4$.
- [x] MORE DIMENSIONS ($13a + 4b + 3c \cdots = 30$)
- [ ] Ring-LWE
- [ ] Other problems based on LWE
