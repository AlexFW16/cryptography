## Trying to find math projects to work on

#### Learning With Errors
- Understand LWE
- First easy implementation (one dimensional matrix), so we are dealing with
  equations in the form of $13s = 4$.
- MORE DIMENSIONS ($13a + 4b + 3c \cdots = 30$)
- Upgrade implementation
- Try to implement more copmlex algorithms that build upon this problem
- PROFIT
