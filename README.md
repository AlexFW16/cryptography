# Repo for learning cryptography
Many of the algorithms are implemented using the structure provided in The Handbook of Applied Cryptography.

### Basics

#### Factoring

- [x] Trial Division algorithm
- [x] Pollard's rho factoring algorithm
- [x] Pollard's p-1 factoring algorithm
- [ ] $\dots$
- [ ] Elliptic Curve Factoring


### Learning With Errors (LWE)
- [x] Basic understanding of LWE
- [x] First easy implementation (one dimensional matrix), so we are dealing with
  equations in the form of $13s = 4$.
- [x] MORE DIMENSIONS ($13a + 4b + 3c \cdots = 30$)
- [ ] Ring-LWE
- [ ] Other problems based on LWE
