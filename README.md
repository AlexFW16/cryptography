## Trying to find math projects to work on

#### Learning With Errors (LWE)
- [x] Basic understanding of LWE
- [x] First easy implementation (one dimensional matrix), so we are dealing with
  equations in the form of $13s = 4$.
- [x] MORE DIMENSIONS ($13a + 4b + 3c \cdots = 30$)
- [ ] Ring-LWE
- [ ] Other problems based on LWE

- [ ] PROFIT
