## Trying to find math projects to work on

#### Learning With Errors (LWE)
[-] Basic understanding of LWE
[-] First easy implementation (one dimensional matrix), so we are dealing with
  equations in the form of $13s = 4$.
[-] MORE DIMENSIONS ($13a + 4b + 3c \cdots = 30$)
[ ] Ring-LWE
[ ] Other problems based on LWE

[] PROFIT
